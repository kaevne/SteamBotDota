Current commit: Jul 10, 2014 Merge pull request #596 from SephirothSG/patch-1 â€¦

Oct 27, 2013:
Did not move in ClientMsgHandler due to issue with protobuf, try to fix later.


Made changes from this issue:
https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/issues/467 to Bot.cs 
I did not make changes to Bot.cs, so I'd recommend reverting it when a fixing commit comes up
also changed steamweb.cs

debug messages are at the very top of trademanager.cs

Used old 20131017 Tradesession.cs and parts of Trade.cs that call into it.  The new tradesession.cs doesn't work properly
